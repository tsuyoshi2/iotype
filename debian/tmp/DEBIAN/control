Description: A library for use with MLton that provides support for Basis Library types
 IOType is a preprocessor that extends Standard ML to provide support
 for automatically generating serialization functions (functions to read
 and write to binary streams) for any type you define.
 .
 This is the library, which provides serialization functions for Basis
 Library types (such as int, char, string, vector, etc.). The library is
 installed into the MLton library directory and a basis file is available
 at $(SML_LIB)/iotype/iotype.mlb.
